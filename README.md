## Topic:
Air Pressure Failure Prediction System


##Summary: 
AdaptiveAlgo Systems Inc. has invited us to help them to develop a Web Application and 
implementing data science solutions. Our team is aiming to deleiver high performance 
solutions in a timely manner. AdaptiveAlgo has provided a problem related to Air pressure 
system failure and operational data in Scania trucks. Our goal is to develop a Web Application 
which makes prediction with minimum Total cost on client's input.
